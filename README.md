# Neural Networks From Scratch

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate experiments with **neural networks implemented from scratch** using Python and Jupyter notebooks.  
No TensorFlow. No PyTorch. Just fundamentals.

The goal is to understand how neurons, forward passes, and learning actually work—by building them manually.
